            1. Defined navigation architecture: Offer a clear and logical navigation structure, allowing users to easily explore different furniture categories, collections, and individual products. A well-designed menu system and search functionality will enable users to find desired products quickly.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Translated concepts into wireframes: Pixel-perfect layout to create a harmonious composition.

            <br />
            <br />
            4. Paid special attention to the Product Page: Users could select more than one variable to personalize their piece, and I wanted to provide as much visual support as we could by creating illustrations of each piece with dimensions and specs. Also, clear product descriptions played an important role to help users make informed decisions. 
            <br />
            <br />
            5. Smooth Checkout Process: Our goal was to minimize friction and encourage conversion. Provided a secure and efficient payment gateway integrated for seamless transactions, and provide clear shipping information and order tracking.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. Responsive Design: Ensured optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
