            One of the major goals was to include an instant quote generator, as during the interview process with past clients we found out that having an approximated price was a game changer, and Metagrama wanted to create a stress-free approach with their potential clients.`,

Simple animations as you hover over buttons or project images adds a pinch of movement that enhances the joy of navigation through this website.`,
