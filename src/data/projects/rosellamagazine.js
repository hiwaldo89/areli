            text: `Rosella Magazine is one of the most relevant magazines in Queretaro. Rosella's team members wanted to create a newer version of their website, one that was both aesthetic and functional, to the users and to themselves as content creators.
            Information architecture was a major series of decisions and iterations until we had a final cut that made sense to the business and the users. 
            The final product is a website where users can find: blog posts, articles, recipes, digital versions of monthly magazines, and a portal for suppliers and potential clients.`,
